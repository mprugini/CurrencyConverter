Currency Converter

- Currency converter widget based the following wireframe and using JSON API from http://fixer.io/ 

- As a user, I can choose between the following currencies: CAD, USD, EUR
- As a user, I can type in the required amount in original currency, and instantly see the converted result in selected output currency
- As a user, I can click on the Disclaimer link and see the additional information about the exchange rate


TODOs for next iteration:
- Work more on a design
- Implement more currencies from fixer.io API such that user can convert any currency that he/she wants.
